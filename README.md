# Where Am I ?

Whre I am it's one of the code clinic c# challanges
To answer this question I used the .NET FRAMEWORK exactly the "System.Device.Location" class to  determine by latitude and longitude coordinates the exact location 
than I used the Google Maps API to point this location in the map 
I gived also the ability to the user to give costume atitude and longitude coordinates for a location and point it .
